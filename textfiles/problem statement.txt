Despite the significant role that UML diagrams play in software development, existing tools for generating them from natural language requirements have several limitations. Most current solutions focus primarily on class diagrams, while neglecting other important diagram types such as use case diagrams. Furthermore, these tools struggle with incomplete requirement documents, restricted input formats, and grammatical inconsistencies, which often result in errors and inefficiencies. As a result, considerable manual intervention is required, reducing the scalability, accuracy, and practicality of these systems in real-world software development environments.
